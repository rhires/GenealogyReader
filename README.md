read some highly massaged genealogy text files

I have a 4th cousin who write genealogy in text which is posted to https://freepages.rootsweb.com/~dmorgan/genealogy/

My task has been to take these files and convert them to a rough csv format, and then read them with a C# program into the gedcom format. 

This is current a work in progress, but I thought it might be useful to make this able to read some other genealogy text file formats, so I release this as open source.
